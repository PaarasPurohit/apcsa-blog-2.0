    "    > Answer here (hack question): \n",
    "- Nesting is a way to organize your code and make it easier to read. It also helps keep your code <u>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</u> . \n",
    "- Nesting is when you put one selector inside another selector. This is a great way to keep your code organized and make it easier to <u>read</u>. \n",
    "- When we make HTML we often nest different <u>elements</u> within each other and have a clear structure when we look at it.\n",
    "- The problem is that in regular CSS we don't have that so we need to use SASS to help us organize our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Warning: Don't nest too much as when the CSS is processed it can make overqualified selectors which can be hard to read and maintain. Which means that it would only target that specific element type and not any other elements that have the same class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sass Nesting**\n",
    "- Through nesting the ul, li, and a selectors within the nav selector makes your CSS better and increases its readability overall."

    "> What is a variable?\n",
    "- A variable is a container that stores <u>information</u> so for instance when you have multiple places that refer to one value you can just use the variable name instead of the value.\n",
    "- This is valuable in SASS because it allows you to reuse that <u>value</u> in multiple places throughout your stylesheet. \n",
    "- The $ symbol is used in Sass to designate a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pro Tip: The reason SASS variables are better than variables in regular CSS is that they are easier to read with a much simpler syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fun Fact: Variables in SASS came before CSS and often SASS has features long before they are actually added to CSS as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable Example Syntax**\n",
    "- $variable-name: value;\n",

    "\n",
    "- In general programming concept where the child class can <u>inherit</u> properties from the <u>parent</u> class. These properties can be changed and modified in the <u>child</u> class. This prevents code from being repeated and makes the code more usable and flexible.\n",
    "- In SASS we have a similar concept that can be used as well we can create base styles and then have other styles inherit from them and then we can change them as we please. \n",
    "- We can do that by through using @extend .name-of-class and then we can add more styles to it as we please. Simple as that."
