    "- Nesting is a way to organize your code and make it easier to read. It also helps keep your code <u>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</u> . \n",
    "- Nesting is when you put one selector inside another selector. This is a great way to keep your code organized and make it easier to <u>read</u>. \n",
    "- When we make HTML we often nest different <u>elements</u> within each other and have a clear structure when we look at it.\n",
    "- The problem is that in regular CSS we don't have that so we need to use SASS to help us organize our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Warning: Don't nest too much as when the CSS is processed it can make overqualified selectors which can be hard to read and maintain. Which means that it would only target that specific element type and not any other elements that have the same class name.\n",

    "\n",
    "SASS, or Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets, stands out as a powerful and efficient tool in the realm of web development. One of its key strengths lies in enhancing the maintainability and readability of CSS code. By introducing features like variables, nesting, and mixins, SASS simplifies the styling process, reducing redundancy and promoting a modular approach to design. The ability to create reusable code snippets through mixins not only streamlines development but also ensures consistency across a project. Furthermore, SASS facilitates the organization of stylesheets by allowing developers to nest styles within their respective components, making the codebase more intuitive. Additionally, SASS supports the use of mathematical operations and functions, enabling developers to express complex styling logic in a more concise and elegant manner. Overall, SASS empowers developers to write cleaner, more efficient CSS, saving time and effort while fostering a more maintainable and scalable codebase."

    "**Popcorn HACK 4 - Quiz (Shaurya)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Choice:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1: Hashing in HashMap**\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the primary purpose of a hash function in a HashMap?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A) <mark>To encrypt the keys </mark>\n",
    "- B) To map keys to corresponding buckets\n",
    "- C) To validate the keys\n",
    "- D) To generate random numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2: Performance of HashMap**\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the time complexity of the get() and put() operations in a well-distributed HashMap?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A) O(log n)\n",
    "- B) <mark>O(n)</mark>\n",
    "- C) O(1)\n",
    "- D) O(n^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Free Response:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3: Key and Value Types in HashMap**\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe the types of objects that can be used as keys and values in a HashMap. Additionally, explain the methods that a class should implement if used as a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>For basic cases, primitive types are used as keys and values in a HashMap. However, any data type of any type of class can be used as a key and value. If a class is used as a key or value, it needs to use the constructor method.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4: Iteration in HashMap**\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide brief explanations for two methods in HashMap that can be used to iterate over its key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>There are more than two. You can use pretty much any type of loop. The best two to use are either a for or for-each loop, because using them to iterate through a list is more efficient to code with.</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5: Thread Safety in HashMap**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain why HashMap is not thread-safe and what issues might arise when multiple threads access the same HashMap instance concurrently. Suggest an alternative class that can be used for concurrent access and explain its benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Based on the lesson, the type of HashMap you would want to use for threads is ConcurrentHashMap, which is built to handle asynchronous and concurrent threading, unlike the regular HashMap.</u>"
