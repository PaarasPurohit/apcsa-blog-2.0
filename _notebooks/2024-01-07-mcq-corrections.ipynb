    "I had a song stuck in my head the whole time. I was pretty jittery when doing the test and was not able to entirely focus. While this is something I've had while taking a lot of other tests, it is something that I think I can improve upon. My goal is to whittle down my question times to at least 2:25, because if I have one hour and thirty minutes to complete 40 MCQ's, then that is the maximum time that I shall grant myself on each question. To solve this, I shall employ deep work strategies to remove distractions at least 8 hours prior to the test to make it as authentic as I can in these circumstances."

While it does represent two independent random numbers being generated, to simulate the rolling of two number cubes, the value of each number should be between 1 and 6 inclusive to produce a sum in the range of 2 to 12. The correct choice was E. The call Math.random() will produce a double between 0 and 1, not including 1. To generate a random number in the range of 1 to 6, the call Math.random() needs to be multiplied by the number of integers you want to generate, in this case 6, giving us Math.random() * 6. This will result in a double between 0 and 6, not including 6. If we type cast this to an int, as in (int)(Math.random() * 6), the result will be an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive. Adding 1 will adjust the range to 1 to 6 inclusive, as in (int)(Math.random() * 6) + 1. This expression will simulate the rolling of one number cube. Since each roll is independent, to simulate rolling two number cubes, we need to use this expression twice which simplifies to 2 + (int)(Math.random() * 6) + (int)(Math.random() * 6)."

The inner loop iterates over the array row accessing each element and assigning it to n. Then n is printed to the screen.

    "Reflecting on my experience practicing the 2015 APCSA (AP Computer Science A) Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQ), I found that it provided valuable insights into my strengths and areas for improvement, particularly in the context of nested for loops, test-driven development, and visualizing 2D array problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, tackling nested for loops revealed both my ability to understand their syntax and structure, as well as areas where I could enhance my efficiency. It became apparent that I should prioritize clarity and readability in my code. To improve, I plan to break down complex nested loops into smaller, more manageable components. Additionally, I will focus on understanding the logic and purpose of each loop, ensuring that the code is not only correct but also easy to follow for both myself and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practice test emphasized the significance of incorporating test-driven development (TDD) principles into my coding process. By constructing meaningful test cases before implementing the actual code, I can create a clear roadmap for the solution. This approach not only helps catch potential errors early but also provides a structured approach to problem-solving. Moving forward, I intend to integrate TDD more consistently into my practice sessions to reinforce this beneficial habit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing 2D array problems emerged as a key challenge during the practice test. Enhancing my ability to mentally represent and manipulate arrays in two dimensions is crucial for solving such problems efficiently. To address this, I plan to engage in more hands-on exercises, such as drawing diagrams or using online tools to visualize arrays. This practice will not only improve my understanding of array structures but also enhance my problem-solving skills in the context of 2D arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the 2015 APCSA MCQ practice served as a valuable learning experience, shedding light on specific areas for improvement. I am committed to refining my skills in nested for loops by prioritizing readability, embracing test-driven development to enhance my coding process, and investing time in visualizing 2D array problems. Through focused practice and continuous learning, I aim to strengthen my foundation in these crucial aspects of computer science."
